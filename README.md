Monkeypox Evolution and Epidemiological Surveillance Project
Overview
This repository is dedicated to the research and surveillance of Monkeypox, a viral disease caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPXV), a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae. The project aims to understand the evolutionary biology of the virus, epidemiological trends, and to help develop better surveillance and control measures. Here you will find relevant datasets, scripts, and analyses concerning the genomic features, phylogenetic relationships, and epidemiological studies of Monkeypox.

About Monkeypox Virus
Biology
Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease similar to smallpox but less severe. It's primarily transmitted to humans from animals like rodents and monkeys. The symptoms often include fever, headache, muscle aches, and a rash. The disease has an incubation period of 5â€“13 days.

Genomic Features
The Monkeypox virus genome is made up of a single, linear, double-stranded DNA molecule that is approximately 196 kb long. It encodes for around 200 proteins and shares about 90% sequence identity with the Variola virus, responsible for smallpox. The genome has a central coding region flanked by two identical inverted terminal repeats (ITRs).
